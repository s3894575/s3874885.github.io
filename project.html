                    <p style="font-style: italic; Color: black;">Overview </p>
                      <p>
My project has chosen the audio playing market to create a viable product that would compete against existing competitors with relevant features and massive cost saving strategies. The main aspects of the device are similar to the Sony Walkman or Astern and Kern portables. It’ll comprise of a non-touch Memory In Pixel screen which only refreshes pixels when necessary unlike a standard LCD to save battery. It will also have a focus on lossless audio codecs such as .WAV and .FLAC to deliver sound that demands a dedicated device for playback. Although it’ll have Bluetooth 5 support, the main selling point will be the high resolution audio DACs (Digital to Analogue Converter) to offer the user analogue sounds which are proven to sound better than any form of wireless transmission which emulate sound waves with ones and zeroes. The hope is to offer a fair priced portable audio device with excellent wired sound quality and brilliant battery life.
                      </p>
                      <p style="font-style: italic; Color: black;">Motivation  </p>
                      <p>
The motivation behind this project is fairly simple: to provide users a portable audio player that isn’t priced ridiculously high and one that focusses on bringing digital sound quality as close to analogue vinyl as possible. The first issue with the current industry and market is that the only good options to purchase with high resolution audio are usually at least $1000aud. Although Sony’s Walkman product is well engineered and reliable, it doesn’t need to be the designed the way it is. The only cheap options made by the main competitors don’t actually support high resolution codecs. As a result, this project would be a challenging and interesting experience trying to engineer a device that brings the main high resolution feature to a cheaper price. It would be interesting to see what features didn’t need to make the cut and how far the screen’s battery saving feature could go for the device. ANXO Components state that when using MIP displays “you address pixels individually, refreshing only those pixels which need to be changed thereby reducing power requirements”. These displays are much cheaper than LCDs and OLEDs, and are obviously a great alternative if the display is one of the areas that can be cheapened (it can as the device is about audio not video). Tom’s Guides say that a Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 last two days in battery life whereas the Garmin Fenix 6 (which uses PIP display) lasts up to forty six days.

                      <p style="font-style: italic; Color: black;">Description  </p>
                      <p>
                        Interfacing: Screen and controls <br>
                        The devices main goal is to create an affordable and excellent output for listening, but the input is an important aspect of user interfacing. As mentioned before, the screen won’t use touch inputs but instead will have a four direction buttons, a select button, an info button, skip/fast-forward button and a back button. The decision to exclude a touch screen and opt for tactile buttons is for a simple reason: this isn’t a smart phone and it doesn’t need to be. The player doesn’t need to use a touch screen  because it only does one thing and will actually function better with dedicated buttons that will ergonomically make the system easy to use and serve the one purpose it is meant to: playing music.
<br><br>Sound and Hi-Fi: Audio codecs and 3.5mm and 6.35mm DACs <br>
An audio playing device is all about output, thus the main selling feature of the project is its focus on digital to analogue converters. The device will have 4 different types of outputs, 2 3.5mm plugs (female connector for aux cables) for headphones/speakers and two 6.35mm plugs for proper sound setups, studios, amplifiers, etc. moreover, the device will have compatibility for audio formats for lossless sounds such as .wav and .flac that are renowned for the depth and clarity offered. These features are key to the listening experience outputted by the device as it keeps the signal as analogue as possible while still using digital files. The reason behind this priority is that sound is essentially just waves and in analogue formats the waves are smooth whereas digital can be described as stairs, sounding better the higher the bitrate.
<br><br>
Storage: Micro SD card slot for expandable storage <br>
Since high bitrate files in the aforesaid codecs are generally much larger than standard .mp3 files, storage is an important aspect of the device that will determine how much music the users can bring with them. The project will include support for two micro SD cards allowing for cheaper storage solutions. Often competitors will not include the external memory support instead choosing to make high price points instead. Where the competitors often include storage built on the system’s chipset, the device will only store the operating system on the onboard storage and all music will be expandable storage. This will keep costs low and competitive while allowing users to upgrade their storage after purchase unlike the restrictive storage solutions on iPhones.
<br><br>
Music: Support for Tidal premium downloads of WAVs and FLACs, importable from local pc files <br>
Although these features are very important to the device’s value to consumers and users, the most essential service is to provide the high resolution music for the user’s listening. Given the current music listening market is predominantly built on streaming services, support for these services’ memberships are essential as they allow users to download the songs for offline listening. The best service to include would be TIDAL’s music streaming and offline downloads as it offers full lossless Hi-Fi and MQA (master quality) audio streaming and downloading .wav files. Including this service means users don’t have to purchase all their favourite songs off of a hi res audio retailing site such as HDtracks.com which very often don’t include modern musicians. For those who would rather transport their own music or files stored locally on a computer, they can always import music to the SD card and start listening straight away.

                      <p style="font-style: italic; Color: black;">Tools and technologies </p>
                      <p>
                        As far as hardware goes, the project will require system on chip (SoC) to keep processing compact and low processor intense. The processing will need to be strong enough to run scripts for the system and be able to render the GUI (graphics user interface). Moreover, casing for the device will need to be designed and constructed to fit the components required. Such components would include the SoC, battery, display, digital signal processor (DSP), and analogue headphone plugs in 3.5mm and 6.35mm sizes for different sound setups along with the unbalanced and balanced options between each size. Software required will be text editors like ATOM and version controller Github to develop the source code of the system and to encode the audio codecs. Equipment needed for the project comprises of computers, component suppliers, soldering tools and staff/developers/engineers.

                      <p style="font-style: italic; Color: black;">Required Skills and Feasibility </p>
                      <p>
The skills required are surrounded by hardware and software design. Balancing these two aspects without overdoing one to keep costs low is essential. For hardware, the skills of soldering and wiring the components together will be vital in creating a working model. Moreover, a casing for the device will need to be constructed as well which could be done with 3d modelling on software such as CAD which can be used in manufacturing systems like 3d printers. To ensure the software isn’t too demanding on the hardware, careful and efficient programming of source code with the minimal amount of functions to reduce battery drain from each CPU clock. Thus, strong knowledge and skills in C++ will also be required for the project. However, sourcing these components has never been easier thanks to the internet’s global market which has made programming even more accessible with version control services, file sharing so a developer doesn’t need to be physically there. Ultimately, the project is fairly feasible but still challenging.

                      <p style="font-style: italic; Color: black;">Outcome</p>
                      <p>If the project was successful, the outcome would allow me and the other developers to enjoy a cheaper .wav player than the competition that creeps above $1000. From a business perspective, the product could be made even cheaper due to mass production and economies of scale. By doing this, the main problem of price will be even further reduced from the project as it could be sold for less and still be sustainable. If this development was successful, it could force major players in the industry to raise their offerings in the cheaper price ranges in order to protect their market share. However, it could also destabilise the perceived value of current portable sound players should this project offer the main high res audio but at lower cost with less bells and whistles.</p>

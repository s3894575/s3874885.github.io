                      <p>
                        This role is an appealing position as it requires a lot of experience in online systems and Cloud architecture. Its emphasis on the transfer of information between servers and systems within the NSW government services would be a rewarding role to achieve as it would link multiple services such as NSW Roads and Maritime to NSW Police, helping officers uphold the law. Altruistic reasons such as this, give a sense of purpose to a role that is challenging and not necessarily the same issues each day. With most systems, there are likely to be incidents and large amounts of debugging required. Moreover, the need for privacy and security adds an extra stake of responsibility and care to the role (cybersecurity is an area I am interested in). Another desirable element of the role is the pay rate, being more than enough. Working on a position like this would bring great experience to any successful applicant/employee which would in turn maintain job prospects.
                        <br><br>

                        The skills, qualifications and experience required for this role are ones that come from many years in the relevant industry. That being said, they are achievable through entry level positions and working to continually grow. Generally, skills required for an IT architect would be management of employees, systems and project management. On one hand, one’s ability to lead and direct their teams will determine the success of the project as well as make realistic decisions towards implementation/completion. In this role, however, one’s experience and qualifications in the IT and cloud architecture is essential as well. Furthermore, if a manger/architect cannot understand the limitations and requirements of a project (or even how a system works on a technical level), they may not be able to lead the team properly. To avoid this, it is essential to have experience in roles prior where the individual carries out the development and implementation of IT systems such as Azure or server protocols, thus being able to use their experience to guide those who they will manage. Moreover, a role like this would require/favour having tertiary education and proven experience at other businesses/organisations.
                      <br><br>
                        My current qualifications, skills and experience are a far cry from where I want them to be to reach a job like that. However, I am working in the direction of building all these areas up. For example, I am currently studying full time in a bachelor’s degree in Information Technology and am looking for any internship or entry level work opportunities to supplement my studies. Moreover, I am focussing on programming based projects outside of university with the sole purpose of growing my skills and potentially be able to do freelance work on the side.

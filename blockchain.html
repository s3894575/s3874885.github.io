                      <p style="font-style: italic; Color: black;">What is it used for?</p>
                      <p>
                        Block chain is the first technology invented to make use of ledgers, through a system called distributed Ledger Technology (DTL). A ledger is where all the information about all the financial information such as assets or transactions of an individual or group of accounts, is recorded and permanently stored. Ledgers have been groups of people or businesses to record and classify monetary transactions to prepare financial statements. The main purpose of ledgers is simply to be used as evidence for transactions that happened between people/organisations because such documentation would be accurate and permanent.
                        <br><br>However, it is only recently that the properties of ledgers have become fully utilised. The most important property of ledgers is their ability to maintain trust between individuals by keeping an account of their transactions. The only downside to ledgers today is the fact that their accuracy and representation of transaction events is purely dependent on the third party that is entrusted to record accounts of individuals, be it banks, governments, departments. This makes ledgers inherently prone to manipulation and corruption(error/fraud). Link to article explaining the corruption of state mandated ledger systems. With this being the case, blockchain technology promises to add the lair of trust between transactions. That is, people can trade with each other through a median of exchange that will maintain its value, and everyone involved is in full absolute agreement of this value.
                        <br><br>As mentioned prior, blockchain was the first implementation of distributed ledger Technology. What makes this ledger system special from the conventional one, is that all the ledgers within a network are the same for everyone. Once a change is made in one ledger and it is proven by the algorithms, all other copies of the ledger are updated to match. Therefore, this system has been created so that individuals have a distributed ledger that is always in consensus, without the need for a third party.

                      <p style="font-style: italic; Color: black;">What makes this technology possible?</p>
                      <p>
                        The first idea that made DTL possible was the concept of triple-entry accounting, conceived by Yuji Ijiri in the 1980s. Triple entry accounting adds a third dimension to the double-entry bookkeeping methods which had existed since the 15th century ad. The double entry has two equal and corresponding sides known as debit and credit. Each party records the credit/debit events that took place during a transaction in their ledgers. Therefore, this system was effective for cross checking transactions and establishing trust between two parties. However, since the evidence of the transaction was kept on each side, there is a chance that the disclosed information is inaccurate or not consistent and could be easily falsified, this makes the auditing process fundamentally limited in its ability to maintain trust.
                        <br><br>Triple entry accounting system tries to overcome the limitations of the double entry accounting by creating a link between the two double entries and one entry recording this link in an immutable book/ledger. This immutable ledger would be visible to the public at any time. Blockchain adopts this by creating a decentralised distributed ledger that records the provenance of a digital asset and because it uses the triple entry system, the data on this system inherently cannot be modified. And every change to the system is recorded in real time as it happens.
                        <br><br>The blockchain ledger records every sequence of transactions from start to finish. No transaction can be added to the chain without consensus from every participant of the system.

                      <p>
                        Cryptocurrencies have the potential to disrupt and evolve the world’s current monetary system. This could mean that there would be a world where paper money or credit and debit cards become absolute technology.  And if done right, unlike paper money that can be printed into oblivion, digital currency will maintain its value over time without hyperinflation, because the programs that govern this space will be fair and impartial.
                      <br><br>  Because the protocol that runs DLT is fair and impartial to all users, it will add a layer of trust to interactions between persons. DLT allows people to transact with each other using the internet anywhere on earth and be confident that they can trust all parties involved.  Blockchain is a trust machine where you don’t need a middleman to tell if one person is lying or not.
                      <br><br>Blockchain will significantly change if not absolve the role of auditing personnel because all records of transactions in the network will be virtually self-audited and made public. It will ensure that ledgers are tamper proof and remove the possibility of human errors or omissions. And it is this idea that the records can be fully trusted that will incentives companies/businesses to endorse cryptocurrency.
                      “This self-auditing accounting ledger is probably the most conclusive application for Blockchain after Bitcoin.” David Hartley.

                        If this technology becomes mainstream, then everyone will be able to understand the concepts DL technology and blockchain technology at least on a level where they can use it efficiently. This may potentially benefit families in regards to payment of bills. That is, there could be technology that will enable individuals or groups to take delivery of a service and only pay as it is used. For example paying for the internet for every second you use it or being billed per thermal unit of gas instead of monthly payments. And during such transactions between individuals or businesses there will be zero frictional costs, as there won’t be a third party draining off economic energy.

                      <p style="font-style: italic; Color: black;">What does it do?</p>
                      <p>
                        Cloud computing constitutes both the applications distributed as services over the internet and the physical hardware and software inside the data centres that provide Cloud services Ambrust et al. (2010). There are three main services cloud computing provides which are Software as a Service, Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service. Infrastructure as a service refers to providing customers with computing power, storage, networks, and other computing resources without the client requiring any physical hardware (Kavis 2014). Platform as a Service offers customers the ability to deploy their application without having to pay for expensive hardware and software hosting capabilities (Kavis 2014). Finally, Software as a Service where the provider takes care of all infrastructure, application logic and everything concerned with the delivery of the product or service (Kavis 2014).
                        <br><br>Businesses are starting to realise that it is difficult to select one cloud provider that meets all the requirements of the business. There is an emerging cloud trend where organisations are moving away from sticking with one provider and embracing a multi cloud or hybrid cloud system (VNT 2021). The advantages of multi cloud being it gives the business an option to take advantage of the best parts of each provider’s service as well as avoiding being locked in by one cloud provider (Cloud Health, 2019). There are disadvantages to this strategy such as spending more resources on security, losing out on single provider perks and the complexity created for management having to deal with multiple providers (Cloud, Health 2019).
                        <br><br>Currently large tech organisations are working on building Quantum computers which could provide a significant breakthrough in cloud computing (Salman Saleem 2020). Quantum computers can solve problems in minutes whereas a regular supercomputer would take several thousand years to solve the same problem. However, this technology is still under development and it will be several years until it is implemented in Cloud technology. While Quantum computer development is being undertaken there are some services such as Amazon Bracket and Microsoft Quantum that aim to get developers up to speed on writing quantum applications (George Lawton 2020). One of the main roles of the cloud up until the time where quantum computers begin to roll out is to provide test environments so that developers get a sense of what it will be like in the future. Secondly to offer organisations the few quantum computers that are currently available via mainframe leasing (George Lawton 2020)

                      <h3 style="font-style: italic; Color: black;">What is the likely impact?</h3>
                      <p>
                        Cloud Computing has a number of positive impacts as an IT technology.  It proves to be a significantly cost-effective technology for many businesses, as it negates the need for an “in-house IT infrastructure”, ensuring that companies do not have to buy extra hardware for their storage systems as they expand, or maintain expensive computer systems. This is because cloud providers allow businesses to pay for software and hardware in a “pay-as-you go” model, so that  businesses no longer have to make up-front, capital investments in computer resources. This also includes automatic updates, so that businesses can have access to the latest software without significant cost.
                        <br><br>Cloud Computing allows businesses quite a lot of flexibility, both for employees and the business itself. For example, employees have the ability to access files and data on any web enabled device from a variety of places, such as their home or while on holiday. Furthermore, cloud computing provides businesses with the ability to upscale or downscale per their requirements without the need to purchase or remove expensive IT hardware and software. Another positive impact of cloud computing is that it allows more efficient collaboration between colleagues, clients etc. in a business, since all work files, records and documents can be made accessible via cloud. Cloud computing also provides businesses with “Business Continuity’’, allowing data to be backed up on the cloud so that, in the event of any natural disaster (such as power failure) or an accident, no data is lost. Cloud Computing is also beneficial to many individuals, as it reduces software costs, and provides users with unlimited storage capacity as well as increased reliability.
                        <br><br>Another impact of Cloud Computing is how it creates many jobs relating to the management of cloud architecture. This includes an increase in traditional roles such as software engineer and Development Operations engineer, as well as the introduction of new jobs – for example: cloud architect and cloud engineer. However, Cloud Computing may also eliminate certain tech roles relating to the management and provision of individual pieces of IT infrastructure, such as in the management of servers and hardware. Despite this, Cloud Computing has proved to be an effective and useful technology in the IT industry.

                      <h3 style="font-style: italic; Color: black;">How will this affect you?</h3>
                      <p>
On a more personal front, cloud computing has grown to be essential in our day-to-day lives. Everyday activities like Banking, Email, Media Streaming and Ecommerce all use the Cloud. Almost all social media apps use Cloud Computing in one way or another, and some are even completely cloud-based. For example, when we upload a photo onto Facebook or Instagram, it is being stored in the cloud. The way in which we entertain ourselves has also been greatly affected by Cloud Computing, as we no longer have to rely on the TV to watch our favourite tv-shows, instead being able to access hundreds of movies, tv-shows and stream many songs through cloud based services like Netflix and Apple Music.
<br><br>Cloud Computing has also made it possible for businesses, such as Amazon, to track our shopping history and other details, thus allowing them to provide us with a more tailored customer experience. However, this also brings with it many security risks, such as malware infections and data breaches, which may lead to customers being more uncomfortable with their information being stored on the Cloud.
<br><br> Another way the Cloud affects us is through the storage of our digital health records, as well as those of our families and friends, in the form of online databases, which can potentially be easily accessed by doctors in order to monitor the health of patients. Additionally, Cloud Technology has been instrumental in providing students new opportunities to learn, especially through universities being able to offer online courses and allowing lessons and other materials to be stored on the cloud, so that students can learn and access data from any place. Some other ways in which cloud computing positively affects us is by lowering setup costs and the cost of maintenance of software and hardware, as well as by providing users with unlimited storage capacity, and increasing the reliability of data storage. Thus, cloud computing can be seen as an integral part of our everyday lives.                      </p>

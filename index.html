                    <p>Background: I was born and raised in Sydney for most of my life, but I am a mix of a Vietnamese mother and a South African father. Growing up here has pretty much made me an Australian who likes I decided to move to Melbourne for a change of scenery and as a way of forcing myself out of the comfort zone. So far it‚Äôs been really exciting not knowing where I am all the time (‚Äúgeographically embarrassed‚Äù is the correct term), but at the same time really confusing. I graduated high school in 2019 and decided to take a gap year for 2020 to work and travel, and for unforeseen reasons I only did the former.<br> <br> I can speak fluent English (big flex I know) and debatable levels of Japanese. Other languages I can speak in include python, java, JavaScript, some mark-up languages, and the big female repellent: Assembly/binary. My two main hobbies are distance running and music producing. I‚Äôve been running long distances for years now and used to compete in middle distance events on the track. With music production, I mainly dabble in hip hop instrumentals and beats with my greatest influences being J Dilla, Kanye West, RZA, NO ID, and Mike Dean.</p>

                      <p style="font-style: italic;">What is your interest in IT?</p>
                        <p>I‚Äôm interested in IT because it defines the world around us now and affects almost everything. Generally Information Technology is a collection of different systems and processes that use inputs to create outputs. My main interest in IT is software development and implementation for music production in its many forms. The reason is due to how modern music is entirely made through digital technology and IT systems. Inputs like microphones and keyboards have become versatile and the output is entirely manipulated by the user. <br><br> Genres such as hip hop, EDM, house music, and pop have massively changed as songs that once required a proper studio, can now be produced entirely off of a laptop. Using DAW‚Äôs (Digital Audio Workstations) have made interested me in the source code within the manipulating tools given to the user and how they work. For example, classical music has followed rules in melodies, rhythm and song structures, but was limited to the instruments existing at the time. Using a DAW such as Ableton Live, it‚Äôs possible to use the existing concepts of music but to add precision and creativity to distortion of sounds.
                        </p>
                      <p style="font-style: italic; Color: black;">When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? </p>
                        <p>My interest in IT started a couple years ago when I tried composing music with computers instead of just analogue instruments. I found that after the admittedly complicated learning curve of Ableton Live I was able to make sounds that didn‚Äôt really fit the classical style I was encouraged to follow. It also breathes life into older sounds and samples, a key element in hip hop instrumentals. My sparked interest came from Kanye West who is renowned for his diverse discography that has changed from soul samples of Lauryn Hill, to Daft Punk and even church choirs. His creativity and unpredictability with hip hop production inspired me to try making my own beats.</p>

                      <p style="font-style: italic; Color: black;">Outline your IT experience (if any). </p>
                        <p>My experience with IT has mainly been on programming and software rather than any hardware. As mentioned in my personal profile, I have experience with programming in languages such as Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, HTML/CSS, C++ and SQL. </p>
                      <p style="font-style: italic; Color: black;">Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </p>
                        <p>Originally planning to study engineering and specialising in software in Sydney at UTS, I decided to swap to Melbourne as my plan during my 2020 gap year and chose RMIT to study IT as I heard it was a really good place to focus on STEM and IT. I also chose IT as I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure if I wanted to study computer science and focus on programming mainly, and instead would be able to start more generally and transfer if I wanted to move in a programming direction.</p>
                      <p style="font-style: italic; Color: black;">What do you expect to learn during your studies? </p>
                      <p>I hope to learn more about hardware systems and how they impact the information process. I believe that a strong understanding of IT requires both hardware and software regardless of which specialisation I am interested in. I also expect to learn some things about working in the IT industry such as project management and working in teams (a key aspect of any IT role). </p>

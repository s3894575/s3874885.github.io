                        <p>My name is Benjamin J.K Wackyereza (S3894575) and I’m a member of Syntax Error. I was born August 3, 2001 in Uganda where I lived my childhood years. I moved to Melbourne Australia with my parents and two brothers when I was turning thirteen and I have lived in Melbourne ever since. Throughout my life, I have had a progression of hobbies, starting from playing video games all day, movies, trying out musical instruments (i.e.; piano and Guitar), reading books to knowing everything about cars and many more in between. At the moment I am trying to explore my dancing abilities. I graduated high school in 2020 and received the VCE-Baccalaureate certificate. Building on from that, I am currently a student at RMIT university studying the Bachelor of Information Technology. <br><br>When I was in school, I researched almost all job fields and weighed the pros/cons of different careers in an effort to find the career that resonated with me. I decided a job in the technology industry was what I wanted. I decided that the Bachelor of IT degree would be a good start as there is a potential to specialise in many different fields of technology. I did not have to think long about which university would suit me, because hearing from my career adviser and other people RMIT was such an obvious choice for me. As a student of IT at RMIT I want to develop skills that will enable me to become anything from DevOps developer or Network administrator to furthering my studies to work in A.I development. </p>

I lived in New Zealand for 14 years and moved to Melbourne,  Australia in 2019. I attended high school in New Zealand until year 10, and then completed the rest of my schooling here in Melbourne.I graduated from Highschool last year and am in my first year of the Bachelor of IT at RMIT. I speak English and Malayalam fluently, and I have also taken classes in French and Latin while at school, however I do not remember much Latin and can only hold a basic conversation in French.  Some of my hobbies include reading - crime fiction novels especially, as well as dancing and sketching. I also play the violin, which I have been doing for around 6 years.For exercise, I enjoy cycling and playing badminton, however, I wish to also start running in the near future.  My interest in IT mainly stemmed from a general interest in computers from a young age, however I had not decided to pursue it as a career until recently. I took VCE Computing in year 11, which led me to become interested in cybersecurity. </p>

                            <p>Hi, my name is Bharath Sudhir Babu (3741660) a member of Syntax Error . I was born in India and moved to New Zealand at the age of 3. All my schooling was completed in New Zealand and after my final year of high school I moved to Melbourne to study my Bachelor of Business (Information Systems) degree at RMIT. My two main hobbies include playing fps games and playing/watching sports such as cricket. My Interest in IT started in my junior year of high school when I was looking to purchase a new mobile. I used to do extensive research of the various brands and models available to compare specifications and was intrigued by the new hardware companies were putting into their devices at the time. After this I wanted to combine my interests in IT and Business together hence the reason, I chose Information Systems as it provided the right balance for me. I don’t have any working experience in the IT field however I have taken courses that taught basic python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

                                <p>My name is Thomas Haddon (S3902505), a member of Syntax Error, I was born here in the south side of Melbourne in Sandringham where I spent the first 3 years of my life, before moving to Phuket in Thailand for 7 years where I began my education from kindergarten all the way to year 4. I then moved to Singapore where I spent the next 8 years of my life going through middle school and high school. In high school I completed the International Baccalaureate, which is an intense 2 year course for the last two years of high school intended to help the student prepare for university. Ethnically I am half Australian and half Indonesian, at home I spoke english with my father and bahasa with my mother. Over the course of my time in school I took courses in French and Spanish and can hold basic conversation in both languages effectively. Because all of my time being abroad outside of Australia, my entire life I have been in international schools. I have interacted with all walks of life from around the world which I am truly grateful for because this has broadened my understanding of many different cultures and traditions. Some of my favourite hobbies include staying physically active by playing rugby and going to the gym regularly. In my free time I love to play video games with my friends or going out and discovering new restaurants with great food. My interest in IT stemmed from PC gaming initially when I was 10 years old and wanted to play Counter Strike: Global Offensive. From there I began learning about PC hardware from the likes of LinusTechTips and GamersNexus where I first learnt how a PC was built. This then snowballed into learning about what each component in a PC does and its purpose.</p>

                                    <p>My name’s Michael Irlandez (S3896810) and I’m one of the members of Syntax Error. I was born in Sydney and lived there until year 4, where I moved down to Melbourne. I am filipino with both parents being so, but my dad is part Torres strait islander, due to his grandmother moving there to escape the whole stolen generation movement back in the 90’s. I am not multilingual, unlike the others, only speaking english at home. My IT interest mainly came from an interest in video games(original i know) and building computers, so i decided to pick it up as an elective back in secondary school, and did it from year 9 to 12. This mainly involved programming in Microsoft visual basics and creating databases in Microsoft Access, so most of the stuff I’ve been doing during this year's courses is quite different. Hobbies aren't too interesting, I enjoy playing video games. Games i've recently been playing are Destiny 2, Satisfactory and Monster hunter world (i'm bad and can't use a controller, so can't play rise). I also collect Yu-Gi-Oh! Cards so that's a thing I do and that's quite the money sink.</p>

                                    <p>My name is Jacob Van Der Heyde Schreuder (S3874885), a member of the Syntax Error team. I was born and raised in Sydney for most of my life, but I am a mix of a Vietnamese mother and a South African father. Growing up here has pretty much made me an Australian. I decided to move to Melbourne for a change of scenery and as a way of forcing myself out of the comfort zone. So far it’s been really exciting not knowing where I am all the time (“geographically embarrassed” is the correct term), but at the same time really confusing. I graduated high school in 2019 and decided to take a gap year for 2020 to work and travel, and for unforeseen reasons I only did the former. I can speak fluent English (big flex I know) and debatable levels of Japanese. Other languages I can speak in include python, java, JavaScript, some mark-up languages, and the big female repellent: Assembly/binary. My two main hobbies are distance running and music producing. I’ve been running long distances for years now and used to compete in middle distance events on the track. With music production, I mainly dabble in hip hop instrumentals and beats with my greatest influences being J Dilla, Kanye West, RZA, NO ID, and Mike Dean.</p>

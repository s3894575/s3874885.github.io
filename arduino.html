                      <p>
                        Microcomputers are exactly that, a small computer that has a microprocessor as a CPU, inputs, and outputs, and memory. These are usually relatively inexpensive, but that is more dependent on the model of the computers. This means anything that has an onboard system built-in is a microcomputer, but the small computing devices that are going to be discussed here are closer to being small PCs rather than something like an electronic lock, that is fixed, but rather these small computing devices allow for users to program and express their creativity.<br><br>

                      <p>
                        The Raspberry Pi is the result of the work of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, an educational charity that is dedicated to making computing accessible to people, and the desire to promote the study of computer science in schools. <br><br>
                          The Raspberry Pi is a small computer that runs Raspbian, a special version of Linux, and due to its size, it’s great for cool projects such as program robots, control systems in your house, or my favorite thing I’ve seen done with a Pi, have a fully contained PC (which the Pi is) but have it contained within a mouse.<br><br>
                          The newest Raspberry Pi is the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, but with the rapid innovation in pc technology, this will likely be not the case with a newer version coming out soon or so. The whole reason the raspberry pi can exist is due to advancements in low-end computing, and the desire to have a practically disposable computer that would allow for users to create what they wanted, with there being options for different expansions on the base model that Pi owners could use in their projects.                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Arduinos, unlike the Raspberry Pi, is not a self-contained pc with an OS, Arduinos are more like a microcontroller where you program it with a set of instructions than the Arduino will perform these instructions, being self-contained after initial programming. The programming language used on is a modified version of C++, and with this, Arduino users are free to program the unit to do what they want, like for example, using the Arduino to wirelessly control parts of your house, such as lights, remotely operate motors on a robot arm for example or even use it as an RFID scanner through the use of different arduinos with certain IO or through the use of shields (expansion cards). From the way the Arduino is described, these sorts of microcontrollers are everywhere, with devices programmed with specific instructions, then after that, the device performs its function. The reason the Arduino is special, due to its stand-alone system that users can buy and use for personal projects.

                      <p>
                        The Makey Makey is a kit based around a microcontroller that allows for users to interact with everyday objects and allows the user to make them into keyboard and mouse inputs as long as it allows for an electric current to pass. The Makey Makey is limited to this feature, with the microcontroller only doing this, but there is a lot of interesting things that could be done with this feature alone.

                      <p>
                        The constant push to more efficient processors, with low tdp’s and interest in the area, will most likely push development in the area of small computers and microcomputers. Development involving small computing devices could lead to more micro-PCs with more power than their predecessors, such as more GPD like devices. The main thing that could change with development in this area is the price and power of these devices, where we would end up with stronger computers, at a cheaper price point.<br><br>
                        Computer and programming enthusiasts will be the most affected by the developments where access to these sorts of devices to build projects on, will become cheaper, and even the general public could benefit from small computers. Devices like laptops and such could be made smaller, and even more portable.<br><br>
                        Due to the whole microcomputers being sort of an enthusiast and inventor sort of interest area, it could lead to more engineering jobs, where Arduino programmers use the device to create new or refine existing devices and can program anything to have the capacity to be controlled remotely. On the other hand, Micro PCs like the Pi need developers to create software and refine the computer’s physical design, so jobs involving software and hardware would crop up with development with small PCs.

                        Development in small computing devices would most likely happen soon as the demand for cheap technology has been going up, with the possibilities of pr
                        Incorporating microcomputers into our lives has already made a difference in many people’s lives. With the addition of controllers in the household such as Google Home and Amazon Alexa, these devices can accomplish the same functions as some projects that can be done with microcomputers, such as being able to remotely control computers and turn off lights. Incorporating microcomputers into our lives would make everyday tasks in our lives easier, and more convenient, basic tasks like turning on anything that runs on electricity could make life easier.<br><br>
                        Having microcomputers and controllers specifically my life (Michael) wouldn’t make things too different, I wouldn’t need to worry about turning on the lights of my room, with sensors controlled by microcomputers doing that for me. I do own a google home and nest, along with a Chromecast, but I don’t use them that much. I would rather use my computer to watch things and listen to music. I used to own a Roomba, but it was a low-end one and thus it didn’t have the advanced room learning A.I, so it would just keep getting stuck, and thus it broke itself.
                        <br><br>Well for others microcomputers would allow for remote control of their home’s appliances for instance I’ve heard of homes where the home’s AC unit can be controlled remotely, so it would be able to warm the house before you got home. Roombas have been getting better so now they would be able to clean people’s homes more effectively. So, pretty much, Microcomputers and Microcontrollers will make the simple task a null issue, and thus leave people with more time to do things they want to.

                      <p style="font-style: italic; Color: black;">What does it do?</p>
                      <p>
                        Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that automatically improves over time with data and experience. Machine learning algorithms take in sample data that is used as a base model. The algorithm then without explicitly being programmed to do so improves over time. These algorithms are ‘trained’ to recognize patterns within large amounts of data(IBM, 2020). If the program is presented with more data, the more accurate the algorithm becomes in decision making and predictions as the program processes more and more data. An example of this is when companies may use machine learning to predict what customers are most likely to buy which product based upon purchase history and frequency. Machine learning makes interpreting massive amounts of data possible and more efficient compared to if a human were to do the same task. Within machine learning there are multiple learning methods that could be set in place over the duration in which the program is active. The first being supervised machine learning, in which the program trains itself based on a labeled data set such as identifying different races of people, in which the algorithm is then trained on various races of people. The adverse method to the supervised method is the unsupervised method in which the program takes in massive amounts of data and then uses the algorithms programmed to extract meaningful data required to label, sort and then classify in real-time without the need of human intervention. Finally there is semi-supervised learning in which is the middle ground between the previous two methods where there is a smaller labeled data set which then guides the program to help guide the classification process of larger unlabeled data sets. <br><br>

                        As a result of the continuous improvement of machine learning, the computing industry has plenty to gain from machine learning with both hardware and software design. It’s used by large organisations such as Alphabet, Microsoft and even streaming services; all of which use large server farms that require efficient and optimised workload management systems. Alphabet’s use of machine learning on the lowest machine level allows their ad profiling services to create personalised advertising to each individual through cookies and machine learning analysis of big data. For example, Alphabet tracks keystrokes and touch inputs to analyse which ads and their imagery are able to hold a user’s attention for longer. This is then used to adjust what types of products are shown and even what colours are used in ads seen by the user. Moreover, Facebook uses facial recognition machine learning to track their users and the places they appear at most (even when they aren't tagged in the image) which then feeds back into its marketing sub procedures and builds a larger profile against users. These methods help contribute to greater client satisfaction in online advertising. <br><br>

                        Although these methods improve software, machine learning has been implemented in many other places within the hardware industry. One example of this is NVIDIA’s development of proprietary resolution scaling and texture rasterization in video game graphics rendering called DLSS. Although it uses classic super sampling techniques to raise a native resolution to display at a higher unnative resolution to save on graphics clock cycles, DLSS uses machine learning to analyse pixels within textures to infer what a higher resolution would look like and then makes a larger frame for the user through this estimation. It allows lower powered graphics systems to display resolutions such as 4k (2160p) from much lower native resolutions. As a result, it encourages more users to adopt NVIDIA’s graphics card solutions to take advantage of this feature that is likely baked onto the actual silicon.

                    <p style="font-style: italic">DLSS is proven here to improve performance and lower demand on the graphics processor, while outputting an image nearly as good as native resolutions. Although imperfect, it is a worthwhile feature.</p>

                      <h3 style="font-style: italic; Color: black;">What is the likely impact?</h3>
                      <p>
                        The likely impact of machine learning is that it will change everyone's lives for better or for worse. As outlined above, machine learning has a large impact on modern society as much as personal computing does; becoming more integrated with most systems each year. Generally, when machine learning is incorporated, someone benefits from it; whether it automates a human process or excels at one better than humans. The main impact is how it is implemented and for what purpose. Targeted marketing on Alphabet’s system is potentially unethical depending on whether it abuses the struggles of a user. According to TorqueMag, Google Adsense is the most popular place to source information; scoring 80.9%. Although it can be opted out of with enough keystrokes and searching, it isn’t an option outlined to the user at initialisation or signup and raises the main impact of privacy regarding personal information, location, characteristics (even addictions which corporations may take advantage of) and contact information. As the nature of machine learning is automation, it is likely to advance and replace many jobs of humans which has its positive and negative aspects to changing society.

                        <br><br>Although often frightening, the advances in machine learning are also used to improve users’ lives and have allowed for major advances in new types of interfaces. For example, Neuralink’s development of learning from brain patterns to then understand what the user wants to input would allow for prosthetics with brain inputs for humans who have lost limbs. The use of machine learning to improve graphics performance is a great example of what could grow into implementations in other silicon fabrications and lead to greater performance that may not have been possible due to the increasing difficulty to reach Moore’s law through simple shrinking of transistors. This issue is largely caused by the fact that transistors smaller than 0.2 nanometers struggle to prevent the signals to jump to other parallel transistors and cause errors. However, machine learning similar to DLSS could prove a better alternative for maintaining and improving the aging of CPUs.
                        <br><br>Another positive of machine learning to advance is that it improves the quality of work for humans and changes the workforce’s needs to focus on what humans are better at. During the 1800s, the industrial revolution led to many automations of manufacturing and ultimately led to more people working in higher income roles and pursuing more meaningful lives. This also lowered the need for manual labour and increased the need for education to more people. Ultimately, machine learning will only be as positive as the people who implement it.

                      <p>
                        The effect of machine learning is already affecting everyday life as it is with the automation of transportation. Modern commercial aircrafts utilize flight management systems(FMS) which is an amalgamation of GPS, computer systems and motion sensors to help track its position during the flight in which the aircraft is being flown by a computer (auto-pilot). This is also seen in self-driving cars but is more complicated as there are other drivers, road rules, limitations in recognizing patterns in traffic. But machine learning allows these cars to continually adapt and recognize changes on the road. Through the use of visual and sensor data, on board computers make split second decisions which can sometimes even beat out other well experienced drivers.
                        <br><br>
                        Another example of machine learning affecting everyday lives is in hospitals. Machine learning allows researchers to better understand diseases through predictive models. Such as developing a vaccine for covid-19. With these predictive models, scientists saw predictions with how certain drugs may interact with the virus, and studied the proteins that make up the virus. By studying its complex structure a program can sort through thousands of elements to identify which are most likely to cause a vigorous immune response. Another key element to this virus is that it is constantly evolving over time, so to ensure that the vaccine remains effective the program needs to identify which components are unlikely and those which are likely to mutate.
